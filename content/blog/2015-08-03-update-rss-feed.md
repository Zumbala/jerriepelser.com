  I am moving my blog to Jekyll soon. Please update RSS feeds
tags:

title: Please update RSS feed subscription to this blog
url: /blog/update-rss-feed/

Hey, just a quick note that I will be switching this blog over to Jekyll sometime in the coming weeks. Unfortunately Jekyll does not seem to support the current feed format for this blog which is `/feed`, and instead requires a `.xml` extension in the URL. So the URL for the feed when I switch over to Jekyll will be `/feed.xml`. 

I have updated the URL for the feed on the current blog to also be `/feed.xml` to ensure a smooth switch over.

I want to ask you however to please re-subscribe to my feed on the new URL which is [http://www.jerriepelser.com/feed.xml](http://www.jerriepelser.com/feed.xml).
